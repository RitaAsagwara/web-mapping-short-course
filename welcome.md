# Welcome to Open Source Cartography: A Web Mapping Short Course

Hello, and welcome to a short, workshop-style course on web mapping. See the [Syllabus](README.md) for more information.

My name is Rich Donohue, and I'm a Visiting Scholar at CU's Department of Geography. I have a Ph.D. in Geography from UW-Madison and have researched and taught web mapping for 5+ years now. My approach emphasizes using open source, web-based tools to create dynamic and interactive thematic maps. You can see more about my work in a program I've helped develop and currently teach for at the University of Kentucky called [New Maps Plus](http://newmapsplus.uky.edu/).

Please arrive at the [Ken Erickson Spatial Data Analysis Lab](http://geography.colorado.edu/research/lab_facility/ken_erickson_spatial_data_analysis_lab) (Guggenheim Rm 6) on Friday, October 28th by 3 pm. We have a lot to learn in 2 hours, but we'll have a lot of fun doing it!

You'll notice that I'm hosting the material for this course on a website called GitHub. I encourage you to [sign up for your own (free) GitHub account](https://github.com/) if you haven't already. It's a useful resource for coders and non-coders, and GitHub offers fantastic [upgrades for students](https://education.github.com/). You can read more about how [I use GitHub in Setting up a Modern Mapping Enviornment and Workflow](https://github.com/rgdonohue/tutorials/blob/master/mapping-environment-workflow/lesson-01.md) in my teaching for U of Kentucky.

Feel free to plan on using one of the lab computers. However, I strongly encourage you to bring and work on your own laptop computer. If you do bring your own computer, download and install the following software before arriving:

* Either the Chrome or Firefox web browser (I will  be instructing using Chrome)
* A text editor such as ([Brackets](http://brackets.io/), [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), or [Atom](https://atom.io/))

If you don't install Brackets and use a Windows machine, it would be very helpful if you had [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your computer. The Mac OS comes with Python installed. 

In the meanwhile, consider reading the following:

* [How web maps work](https://www.mapbox.com/help/how-web-maps-work/)
* [Leaflet Quick Start Guide](http://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/)
* [Maptime Lessons and Resources](http://maptime.io/lessons-resources/)

If you have no background in web design or development, some people find the free Codeacademy courses on [HTML and CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web) or [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript) helpful.

Feel free to email me with questions at donohuer@colorado.edu.
